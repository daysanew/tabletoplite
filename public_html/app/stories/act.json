Down the street, barley visible, you spy a group of city guards under attack from what looks like orcs. As you watch you see a huge boulder, thrown from a distant catapult, come crashing down into a nearby building. After a few seconds the building collapses in on itself. You see more boulders raining down on the city, some even exploding on impact from magical enchantment.\nLooking up you see one of the boulders flying towards the innâ€¦ (-2 story modifier)",
